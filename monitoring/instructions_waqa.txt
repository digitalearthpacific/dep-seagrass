1. Please make sure only to work from the monitoring folder
2. Use a single low cloud image
3. We will have to train a new model since we are working with different bands as we don't have the geomad. 
4. Will work with you on this on Wednesday but on Tuesday try to get as far as you can by following the examples - our case study is Tonga based on the email I sent. 


Let us know if you have any questions.
